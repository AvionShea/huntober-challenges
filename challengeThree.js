Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.

Return your answer as a number.

assert.strictEqual(sumMix([9, 3, '7', '3']), 22);
assert.strictEqual(sumMix(['5', '0', 9, 3, 2, 1, '9', 6, 7]), 42); 
assert.strictEqual(sumMix(['3', 6, 6, 0, '5', 8, 5, '6', 2,'0']), 41); 

ask is if it's contiguous

arr -> int as str and reg nums -> no negs -> always an arr
return sum as a num

function sumMix(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((acc, currentValue) => acc + +currentValue, 0);
};

//refactor
const sumMix = arr => arr.reduce((a, c) => a + +c, 0)

console.log(sumMix([9, 3, '7', '3']), 22);
console.log(sumMix(['5', '0', 9, 3, 2, 1, '9', 6, 7]), 42);
console.log(sumMix(['3', 6, 6, 0, '5', 8, 5, '6', 2, '0']), 41);
