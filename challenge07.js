771. Jewels and Stones

Hint
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3


Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

function numOfJewelsInStone(jewels, stones) {
  const map = {};
  let count = 0;

  //confirm all the jewels -> loop
  for (const jewel of jewels) {
    map[jewel] = true;
  }
  //compare all of the stones to see if they're jewels
  for (const stone of stones) {
    if (map[stone]) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

console.log(numOfJewelsInStone("aA", "aAAbbbb"), "3");
